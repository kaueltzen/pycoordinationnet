## CRYstal feaTURES (CRYTURES)

First, we download a material from the materials project:
```python
from pymatgen.ext.matproj import MPRester

mid = 'mp-12236'

with MPRester("Q0tUKnAE52sy7hVO") as m:
    structure = m.get_structure_by_material_id(mid, conventional_unit_cell=True)
```

The crystal features can be computed directly from the structure object:
```python
from crytures import featurize

features = featurize(structure)
```

The *features* object is a dict object with as many items as there are atoms in the material. The items can be accessed with the atom/site index. Each item contains the oxidation state of the atom (*oxidation*), the local environments (*localEnv*), the nearest neighbor distances (*NN_distances*), the poly distances (*poly_distances*), and the angles between connecting atoms (*connectivity_angles*). Note that complex strategies can return multiple local environments for each site.
